# DuelingOptimization

DuelingOptimizationR is an R package that implements algorithms for convex optimization with preference-based (dueling) feedback, based on the paper “Dueling Convex Optimization” by Saha et al. This package provides tools for performing convex optimization using only noisy binary feedback on pairs of decision points, as opposed to direct gradient or function value information. The algorithms are suitable for applications like recommender systems, ranking, and online learning, where preference feedback is commonly available.
